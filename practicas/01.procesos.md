## Process

## Exercise 2.1
1.
By searching the pattern `/ppid` and then `n/N` for moving upwards/backwards, we find **7** ocurrences
2. 
Command:
```bash
opc :: ~ » ps -o cmd,tty,pid
CMD                         TT           PID
/usr/bin/zsh                pts/3      45474
ps -o cmd,tty,pid           pts/3      45521
```
vs
```bash
opc :: ~ » ps -o cmd,tty,pid
CMD                         TT           PID
/usr/bin/zsh                tty2      	45476
ps -o cmd,tty,pid           tty2      	45556
```
- The TT column is different (terminal emulator vs virtual console)
3. 
Command
```bash
opc :: ~ » ps -o pid,comm   
    PID COMMAND
  45474 zsh
  45926 ps
opc :: ~ » ps -o pid,cmd 
    PID CMD
  45474 /usr/bin/zsh
  45936 ps -o pid,cmd
opc :: ~ » 
```
- Cmd: shows the name of the executable, including also the argument passed. If the command is not a bash built-in, the command show the absolute path of the executable. See the diference using bash instead of zsh:
```bash
[op@opc ~]$ ps -o pid,cmd
    PID CMD
  45474 /usr/bin/zsh
  46074 bash
  46113 ps -o pid,cmd
[op@opc ~]$ 
```
- Comm: shows the name of the command
4. 
Command:
```bash
systemd

├─kdeinit5─┬─file.so
│          ├─kaccess───2*[{kaccess}]
│          ├─kded5─┬─konsole─┬─zsh───tmux: client
│          │       │         └─7*[{konsole}]
│          │       ├─konsole─┬─zsh
│          │       │         └─6*[{konsole}]
│          │       ├─konsole─┬─zsh───pstree
│          │       │         └─6*[{konsole}]
│          │       └─6*[{kded5}]

```
We have the following structure:
- pstree process
- zsh: parent process acting as the interpreter who executes de pstree command
- konsole: terminal emulator used
- kded5: consolidates several small services in one process.
- kdeinit5: kdeinit5 is a process launcher somewhat similar to the famous init used for booting UNIX. It executes KDE programs and kdeinit loadable modules (KLMs) starting them more efficiently.
And by looking a the whole structure more precisely:
```bash
kdeinit5(1436)─┬─file.so(2095)
               ├─kaccess(1447)─┬─{kaccess}(1448)
               │               └─{kaccess}(1460)
               ├─kded5(1440)─┬─konsole(26378)─┬─zsh(26387)───tmux: client(29455)
               │             ├─konsole(45467)─┬─zsh(45474)───pstree(48850)
               │             │                ├─{konsole}(45468)
               │             │                ├─{konsole}(45469)
               │             │                ├─{konsole}(45470)
               │             │                ├─{konsole}(45471)
               │             │                ├─{konsole}(45472)
               │             │                └─{konsole}(45473)
```
we can see the whole hierarchy with the pid associated to them with the threads associated ({})
5.
By looking, in my case, through a tmux instance, we see the following structure:
```bash
opc :: /tmp » pstree -c -g -p 29457        
tmux: server(29457,29457)─┬─zsh(29458,29458)
                          ├─zsh(29500,29500)───evince(35564,35564)─┬─{evince}(35568,35564)
                          │                                        ├─{evince}(35569,35564)
                          │                                        ├─{evince}(35571,35564)
                          │                                        └─{evince}(35588,35564)
                          ├─zsh(37609,37609)───vim(37739,37739)
                          ├─zsh(37756,37756)───vim(37994,37994)
                          └─zsh(38636,38636)
opc :: /tmp » 
```
where:
- Each tab is represented as a new child process, where all of them have a common parent -tmux: server
- We can see the same structure in each "tab-window". An instance of zsh (alternative of bash) that executes the corresponding application (evince, vim)
6.
By opening an xterm console, we see the following:
```bash
|-plasmashell(1498,1496)
|                        |-xterm(54003,1496)---zsh(54006,54006) ...

```
- The parent process is not the same as we are not using a native kde application, which were controlled by a kde5 process.
7. 
We have the following:
- t1: running in foreground. The terminal is "blocked" and we can not execute another program
- t2: running in the background. We can execute other programs in the terminal and we have the pid associated with the xclock program (pid: 54875)
8.   
Where the possible states are the following:
```
PROCESS STATE CODES
       Here are the different values that the s, stat and state output specifiers (header "STAT" or "S") will display to describe the state of
       a process:

               D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
               I    Idle kernel thread
               R    running or runnable (on run queue)
               S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
               T    stopped by job control signal
               t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
               W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
               X    dead (should never be seen)
               Z    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent
``` 
- t1: by executing
```bash
opc :: ~ » ps -C xeyes -o pid,state,tty,ppid
    PID S TT          PPID
  54854 S pts/10     37756
opc :: ~ » 
```
where the states a
- t2: 
```bash
opc :: ~ » ps -C xclock -o pid,state,tty,ppid
    PID S TT          PPID
  54797 S pts/3      45474
opc :: ~ » 
```
We can see that:
- We have differents tty, as we are using differents "konsole" windows
- Each one has a different PPID, as they are created from differents zsh instances

9.
```bash
opc :: ~ » kill -9 37756
```

10. 
First we tried to do it with zsh, but zsh does not enable orphan process, as when you type exit(terminating the zsh processs) zsh terminates all the background process iniciated by zsh.
So we then do it with bash:
- PPID: 57901
Then:
```bash
opc :: ~ » ps -C xclock -o pid,state,tty,ppid
    PID S TT          PPID
  57936 S pts/2          1
opc :: ~ » 
```
- As we see it, now the process has the init process (PID=1) as a parent
